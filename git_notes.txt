create local repo - git init (initalise where repo will live)
stage files(lets git know files are ready to get commited) - git add - example add *.txt
commit - git commit - m " " - example git comitt -m "initial commit to master branch"
status command - git status -- lets you see the list of changes before you commit
see detailed list of all changes committed including messages - git log
not detailed list - git shortlog	
if you need to work on something else - git stash - changes will be gone
to get them back when ready to work on file again - git stash apply
git checkout test1- resets file back to lastest changeset if you dont want the changes from stash apply
amend - git add file.txt // git commit --amend - m"message"

git status - to see if there are pending changes
git show - see commit details - example git show 387f462e792ef6f4621a01202a0d1427b40fcb9f

branch out idea to try out something or work on a different feature without effecting other parts

create branch from files - git branch v2.0// git checkout v2.0

TO switch back to master without merging - git checkout master(branch files will disappear)

switch back to branch - git checkout v2.0 (branch files will reappear)

To merge go back to master - git merge v2.0



To retrieve code from a shared reop you perform a pull operarion and when finished push



create github repo
	enter command to set up connection- git remote add origin https://github.com/padraigdillane/Demo.git
	git push -u origin master
	padraigdillane umwr9xuu


workflow
pull - makes changes - commit locally(many times) - possibly branch and merge locally - pull(resolve conflicts - other people made to your local repo) - push(into centeral repo)

example

git pull
git add *.*
git commit -m "changes to will be pushed to remote repo"
git pull - check if anyone has made a change
git push
