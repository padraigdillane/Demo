create local repo - git init (initalise where repo will live)
stage files(lets git know files are ready to get commited) - git add - example add *.txt
commit - git commit - m " " - example git comitt -m "initial commit to master branch"
status command - git status -- lets you see the list of changes before you commit
see detailed list of all changes committed including messages - git log
not detailed list - git shortlog	
if you need to work on something else - git stash - changes will be gone
to get them back when ready to work on file again - git stash apply
git checkout test1- resets file back to lastest changeset if you dont want the changes from stash apply
